# OWDT's SHADER Sandbox
This project is a sandbox of tools I have been using to experiment with shaders using OpenGL.
It's sort of transformed into a small engine I am building to learn graphics programming.

To compile and run locally, at least on Linux where I am developing this command sequence should do the trick:
```
cd your_build_dir
cmake project_root
make
./run
```
